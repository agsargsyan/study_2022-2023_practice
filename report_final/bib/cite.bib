  abstract     = {This paper presents Random Early Detection (RED) gateways for congestion avoidance in packet-switched networks. The gateway detects incipient congestion by computing the average queue size. The gateway could notify connections of congestion either by dropping packets arriving at the gateway or by setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue size exceeds a preset threshold, the gateway drops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, where the exact probability is a function of the average queue size. RED gateways keep the average queue size low while allowing occasional bursts of packets in the queue. During congestion, the probability that the gateway notifies a particular connection to reduce its window is roughly proportional to that connection's share of the bandwidth through the gateway. RED gateways are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestion control protocol such as TCP. The RED gateway has no bias against bursty traffic and avoids the global synchronization of many connections decreasing their window at the same time. Simulations of a TCP/IP network are used to illustrate the performance of RED gateways.},

Expressions for the steady-state goodput for each flow and the average queuing delay at each queue are derived. The framework is extended to include a class of RED queues that provides differentiated services for flows with multiple classes. Finally, the analysis is validated against ns simulations for a variety of RED network configurations where it is shown that the analytical results match with those of the simulations within a mean error of 5%. Several new analytical results are obtained; TCP throughput formula for a RED queue; TCP timeout formula for a RED queue and the fairness index for RED and tail drop.},

  abstract  = {The existing RED algorithms act on subscribers and edge routers only, and the link capacities between edge routers and connected core routers have not been considered. When core router in a two layers' network experiences congestion, the connected edge routers have no ability to response their access data rates. Thus, it is difficult to achieve the congestion control for the large scale network with many edge routers and core routers. To solve the problems, we propose two multiple RED routers algorithms of congestion control for two layers' network. One RED algorithm implements fair link capacities of edge routers, and the other one implements unequal link capacities of edge routers, but require the core routers to have multi-queues buffers and multiple RED to support. The proposed algorithms achieve the network congestion control by operating RED parameters on the conditions of proposed three theorems for core and edge routers. The dynamic simulation results verify the proposed control algorithms for core and edge routers to be valid.},

  abstract     = {Quality of Service (QoS) generally refers to measurable like latency and throughput, things that directly affect the user experience. Queuing (the most popular QoS tool) involves choosing the packets to be sent based on something other than arrival time. The Active queue management is important subject to manage this queue to increase the effectiveness of Transmission Control Protocol networks. Active queue management (AQM) is an effective means to enhance congestion control, and to achieve trade-off between link utilization and delay. The de facto standard, Random Early Detection (RED), and many of its variants employ queue length as a congestion indicator to trigger packet dropping. One of these enhancements of RED is FRED or Fair Random Early Detection attempts to deal with a fundamental aspect of RED in that it imposes the same loss rate on all flows, regardless of their bandwidths. FRED also uses per-flow active accounting, and tracks the state of active flows. FRED protects fragile flows by deterministically accepting flows from low bandwidth connections and fixes several shortcomings of RED by computing queue length during both arrival and departure of the packet. Unlike FRED, we propose a new scheme that used hazard rate estimated packet dropping function in FRED. We call this new scheme Enhancement Fair Random Early Detection. The key idea is that, with EFRED Scheme change packet dropping function, to get packet dropping less than RED and other AQM algorithms like ARED, REM, RED, etc. Simulations demonstrate that EFRED achieves a more stable throughput and performs better than current active queue management algorithms due to decrease the packets loss percentage and lowest in queuing delay, end to end delay and delay variation (JITTER).},

The proposed AQM algorithm by the IETF is Random Early Detection (RED). The RED algorithm allows network operators simultaneously to achieve high throughput and low average delay. However, the resulting average queue length is quite sensitive to the level of congestion. In this paper, we propose the Refined Adaptive RED (RARED), as a solution for reducing the sensitivity to parameters that affect RED performance. Based on simulations, we observe that the RARED scheme improves overall performance of the network. In particular, the RARED scheme reduces packet drop rate and improves goodput.},
